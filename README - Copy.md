## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I will continue focus on:

- Focus to master SCSS technique.
- Focus on bootstrap doc to learn more about the framework
- Focus on semantic and accessible HTML
- Focus on work with figma design files to simulates the real work project.
- Focus on estimated time for the projects and made the deadline without delays.
